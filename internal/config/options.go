// Option describes one settable configuration path.
//
// The registry below is what lets a caller outside the process discover and
// change a setting. Before it, a runtime set-config knew six hardcoded paths,
// so the sidebar, the dock and everything else in the file were reachable only
// by editing the file and reloading.
type Option struct {
	Path        string   `json:"path"`                 // dotted toml path, e.g. "appearance.sidebar.position"
	Type        string   `json:"type"`                 // bool, int or string
	Section     string   `json:"section"`              // grouping for display
	Description string   `json:"description"`          // one line

	Default     string   `json:"default"`              // what DefaultConfig holds, rendered as a string
	Min         int      `json:"min,omitempty"`        // int options only
	Max         int      `json:"max,omitempty"`        // int options only, and only when a range is enforced
	Deprecated  string   `json:"deprecated,omitempty"` // why it is deprecated and what replaced it
	// Color marks a string option whose value is a colour literal. The type
	// stays string because that is what the field holds and what crosses the
	// protocol; this says what the string means, which is what lets the settings
	// panel offer a colour picker instead of a text field and what makes an
	// unparseable colour an error at the CLI rather than a broken border later.
	//
	// A colour option with Accepted set takes either one of those keywords or a
	// literal, which is the scrollbar tint's shape.
	Color bool `json:"color,omitempty"`
	// Theme marks the string option whose value is a registered theme id. Like
	// Color it says what the string means rather than what it is, and for the
	// same reason: the set is open (a user's own theme file joins it) and far
	// too long to publish as Accepted, so neither a closed set nor no check at
	// all is right. Without it a misspelled theme was recorded, reported as
	// applied, and drew the palette it already had.
	Theme bool `json:"theme,omitempty"`
	// GlyphSet marks the string option whose value is a glyph set id. Like
	// Theme it names an open set kept in a directory of its own, so neither an
	// Accepted list nor no check at all is right, and for the same reason:
	// without it a misspelled set is recorded, reported as applied, and draws
	// the glyphs it already had.
	GlyphSet bool `json:"glyph_set,omitempty"`
	// Percent marks an int option whose value is a share of something, with
	// Min and Max as the real ends of its travel rather than as a guard against
	// a silly number. Like Color and Theme it says what the value means rather
	// than what it is, and it is what earns the option a gauge on the settings
	// panel and a % after its number.
	//
	// The line it draws is between a proportion and a count. Both are ints with
	// a Max, but a gauge on a count says nothing: notifications.duration allows
	// up to an hour, so the usual four seconds would draw an empty bar, and
	// appearance.scrollback_lines allows a million, so ten thousand would too.
	// A proportion is the case
	// where the far end is a place you would actually put the value, which is
	// the only case where seeing how far along it sits tells you anything.
	Percent bool `json:"percent,omitempty"`
	// Follows names the option whose value this one takes while it is unset.
	// Such an option takes the empty string as a value, which clears it, so
	// it can go back to following once it has been set.
	Follows string `json:"follows,omitempty"`
	// BoxSize marks a string option whose value is a size in cells (60) or
	// percent (80%), read by ParseBoxSize. An empty value means the default.
	BoxSize bool `json:"box_size,omitempty"`
