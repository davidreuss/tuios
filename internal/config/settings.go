// Settings is every appearance and behaviour value a running session reads.
//
// It is a struct rather than a wall of package variables because one tuios
// process is not one user. `tuios ssh` and tuios-web each run a goroutine per
// connection, so a package variable that the settings page writes on every
// keypress is a setting the person on the other connection did not choose. Each
// session holds its own copy; the settings page writes into that copy, and the
// panes beside it on somebody else's screen keep the border, the zen mode and
// the rail their own reader picked.
//
// A value, copied once per connection, so a read costs a field offset and no
// session can ever see another halfway through a write. Nothing here is a
// pointer or a map for the same reason.
//
// The theme is deliberately not in here yet. It is a package of its own with
// style caches keyed off it, and it is still process-wide under a server; see
// the note the settings page carries on that row.

	// SidebarFileIcons draws a nerd font icon per file type in the files

	SidebarFolderClick string
	// RailHeaderCase is how the rail's section headers read: "lowercase"

	RailHeaderCase string
	// SidebarEditor is the terminal editor command; empty uses the environment.

	//
	// It is a setting because the rail is beside a terminal rather than in front
	// of one. A file manager is a place somebody went; a rail is a place they
	// are, and not everybody wants the folder they are looking at to be one they
	// can delete from by mistake.

	// SessionBorder carries the session's colour on every pane border, not only
	// on the rail. It is off by default because it changes the look of every
	// window, and it is separate from SessionColors so the rail's marks and the

	//
	// It is for telling one machine from another at a glance. Once panes can be
	// attached on several machines, the session is the thing every pane in the

	// you are looking at without reading the rail.
	// SidebarGitDirty adds the count of staged, changed and untracked paths to
	// the rail's git section.
	//
	// Separate from the section itself because it is the only part of it that

	//
	// Hovering a column with that setting on is the same statement clicking one
	// is: it is how you pick the pane to work in, and there is no other gesture
	// to make. Without it the focus moved to a column that stayed half off the
	// edge, so the pane you had just focused was the one you could not see.
	//
	// It does nothing unless appearance.focus_follows_mouse is on, since
	// nothing focuses on hover otherwise.
	NiriHoverReveals bool

	SessionBorder bool

	// GlobalSession offers a session that holds panes from more than one

	// The default, 90, is where the next column stops peeking in at the edge,
	// which is the only thing that says the strip has one. Raising it to 100
	// gives a column the whole screen: it is the ask from somebody who wanted a
	// pane at full width without zooming, because zooming costs them the fast
	// window switching the strip is for. The peek is what that trades away,
	// which is why it is a setting and not the new default.
	//
	// Read it through GetScrollColumnMax, never directly: a Settings built by

	// percent. 100, the default, is the whole of it.
	//
	// Below 100 the layout around the pane stays on screen at the edges, which
	// is the scrolling layout's peek in both directions at once: a zoom that

	// for. The green disc is the control everybody already knows.
	WindowButtonZoom bool

	// ZoomFollowsFocus hands the zoom to the pane the focus lands on.
	//
	// A zoomed workspace shows one pane. If focus moved underneath it, the
	// next-pane key would focus the pane after it while the zoomed pane kept
	// the box, and keys would go to a pane nobody can see. The zoom is the
	// statement that you want one pane and the whole region for it; a focus
	// move is the statement of which pane.
	ZoomFollowsFocus bool

	// ZoomAnimation slides a pane between its tile and the zoom box instead of
	// swapping the two in one frame.
	//
	// Without it, zoom is a cut: the pane is at its tile in one frame and
	// filling the region in the next, with nothing to say which pane has grown.
	// That is worst exactly when it matters, which is a zoom that moves from one pane to
	// another, where two panes change at once and neither says so.
	ZoomAnimation bool

	// ZoomBorderless makes a zoom the whole pane region with no chrome: the
	// zoomed pane drops its border and title bar, and its guest is told the
	// full size of the region. zoom_size and zoom_max_width do not apply while
	// it is on, since a pane with no border has nothing to show around it.
	ZoomBorderless bool

	// DimUnfocused is how far an unfocused pane's content is carried toward the
	// pane's own ground, as a percentage. Zero, the default, draws every pane's
	// content the same.
	//
	// One number rather than wezterm's hue, saturation and brightness triple. A
	// blend toward the ground already moves saturation and brightness together,
	// because a pane's ground is both darker and flatter than the text on it, and
	// rotating the hue of somebody else's program output is a novelty rather than a
	// thing a rice wants. One number is also the only form that says the same thing
	// on a light theme as on a dark one.
	DimUnfocused int

	// DimMultifocus dims the panes in the multifocus set like every other
	// unfocused pane. False, the default, leaves them undimmed: they take the
	// keys the user types, and full-strength content is what says so.
	DimMultifocus bool

	// Background is the ground painted on every surface that does not set
	// its own: "off", the default, leaves the default background transparent
	// so the host terminal shows through; "theme" paints the active theme's
	// background; a #RRGGBB literal paints that colour.
	//
	// PaneBackground, DesktopBackground, WindowChromeBackground,
	// DockBackground and SidebarBackground are each surface's own setting.
	// Each takes the same values, and empty follows Background. Only cells
