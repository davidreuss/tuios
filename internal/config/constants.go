// Any program's output can carry OSC 52, including a file an agent prints, so

// ignores these writes by default, but that breaks the yank in an editor over
// ssh, which is what OSC 52 is mostly for, and that yank always comes from the
// pane the user is typing in. So the default lets the focused pane write, and
// says so on the dock when the text holds a line break or a control character. A write from any other pane waits for the
// user to allow it, which is what ask does for every pane.

// Whatever the mode, the pane keeps its own copy, so the program that set it
// reads it back with an OSC 52 query.
