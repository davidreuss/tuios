// panesBorderless reports whether the panes this client is arranging drop their
// own border boxes in favour of one divider drawn between them.
//
// It is the single answer to a question three parts of the app used to work out
// for themselves from the shared-borders setting alone: which border a pane
// draws, whether a separator is painted between two of them, and how many
// columns the layout keeps free for that separator. The setting is only half of
// it. Shared borders merge nothing unless tiling is arranging the panes, and
// the scrolling layout never merges at all, so a pane under any of those keeps
// its own box.
//
// It reads the session-settled m.SharedBorders, never config.SharedBorders:
// this is geometry, and geometry inputs have to be identical on every client of
// a session (see the field comment in os.go).
func (m *OS) panesBorderless() bool {
	// Stacked mode always merges: a collapsed bar is one row, and a border box
	// drawn around one row of guest output is not a bar at all.

// separatorGap is the columns the layout keeps between two neighbouring panes.
//
// Borderless panes need one whatever the user asked for: their rectangles are
// guest output from edge to edge, and the divider the user sees is an overlay
// painted in the column between them, so a gap of zero there leaves the divider
// nowhere to go. Panes drawing their own borders need none by default. Their
// two adjacent border columns already divide them, so a third column would draw
// nothing, and every pane on that side of every split would be a column
// narrower for it.
//
// appearance.gap is what the user adds on top of that floor, which is i3's
// inner gap: empty ground between the panes, not a wider divider.

// reclaimSeparatorGaps re-lays-out every workspace's panes at the gap the
// layout now reserves, so a column held open for a divider that is no longer
// drawn goes back to the panes beside it instead of sitting empty.
//
// It runs on the toggle itself rather than lazily when a workspace next comes
// into view, for two reasons. Every workspace is still standing in the
// arrangement the tiler gave it at this moment, so redoing its rectangles is
// safe; once tiling is off the user is free to drag those panes about, and
// redoing the layout then would throw that arrangement away. And a workspace
// left holding the gap is the stranding this area has produced before: panes
// drawing their own boxes inside rectangles still spaced for a separator, with
// nobody to settle them but a retile that never runs.
//
// Geometry is applied directly rather than eased into. A pane growing by a
// single column has nothing to travel, and the mode switch it follows is
// structural.
