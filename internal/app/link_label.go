// An underline says a run of cells is a link. It does not say where the link
// goes, and for an OSC 8 hyperlink the two have nothing to do with each other:
// the words on the screen are whatever the program chose, and the address is
// hidden behind them. A label that does not name the target would therefore be
// a feature that asks the user to click and find out.
//
// So the label names the target and says what to press. It is the whole of the
// feature's discoverability: nothing else on screen mentions the shortcut, and
// a hover that only underlines teaches nobody that a click would do anything.
//
// It appears with the underline rather than after a delay. The tooltip surfaces
// wait 350 ms because crossing a control on the way somewhere else should pop
// nothing; a link is different in that crossing one is already drawing the
// underline, so a delayed label would be a second thing arriving late to
// explain the first.

// linkLabelHint is what the label says about acting on the run. It is the only
// place in the interface that names the gesture, so it follows
// appearance.link_click. With both clicks on (the default) it names ctrl+click, because that
// is the one most outer terminals pass on to tuios.
//
// The same holds on macOS. Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm and Terminal.app all pass
// ctrl+click on to tuios, and none of them opens the OSC 8 link on cmd+click
// while the program reports the mouse, so the label never names cmd+click.
