// An underline says a run of cells is a link. It does not say where the link
// goes, and for an OSC 8 hyperlink the two have nothing to do with each other:
// the words on the screen are whatever the program chose, and the address is
// hidden behind them. A label that does not name the target would therefore be
// a feature that asks the user to click and find out.
//
// So the label names the target and says what to press. It is the whole of the
// feature's discoverability: nothing else on screen mentions the shortcut, and
// a hover that only underlines teaches nobody that a click would do anything.
//
// It appears with the underline rather than after a delay. The tooltip surfaces
// wait 350 ms because crossing a control on the way somewhere else should pop
// nothing; a link is different in that crossing one is already drawing the
// underline, so a delayed label would be a second thing arriving late to
// explain the first.
//
// The label is the one part of the link hover that some screens have no room
// for, so appearance.link_label turns it off and leaves the underline, the
// pointer and the click to carry the feature.

// linkLabelHint is what the label says about acting on the run. It is the only
// place in the interface that names the gesture.

// linkLabelMax bounds the address. A URL can be thousands of characters and the
// label is one row on a screen that is not; the end is trimmed rather than the
// middle, so the scheme and the host, which are what tell a user whether they
// trust it, always survive.
