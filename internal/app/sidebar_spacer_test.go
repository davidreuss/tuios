// spacer is shrunk before any section is, and it is shrunk to nothing before a
// section gives up its first line, so the sections a person can read survive a
// short rail and the gap between them does not.
//
// Measured on the allocator rather than on the frame, because the render's own
// truncation cuts an overrunning rail back to its band: a spacer that refused
// to give anything up still looks right on screen and takes a section off the
// bottom of it, which is a symptom the frame cannot tell apart from a rail that
// is simply full.
