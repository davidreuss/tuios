// A popup is a floating pane that runs one command and closes when the command
// exits. The daemon opens it and marks it; this file is the client's half, which
// is the box.
//
// The box is computed here rather than adopted from the sync, the way the zoom
// box is and for the same reason: a popup is centred in the content region, and
// the content region is this client's own size less the reserve the session
// agreed. A peer of another size that adopted the rectangle would draw the popup
// in a corner or off the edge, and would hand the shared shell a second size.
// So the size the caller asked for travels and every client resolves it against
// its own bounds.

// popupRect is the box a popup fills on this client: the size the caller asked
// for, centred in the content region.
//
// The content region is the box the session agreed the panes go in, beside a
// reserved sidebar band and clear of the dock rows, and it is the same box
// zoomRect measures against, so a popup can never be drawn over the chrome.
//
// A request wider or taller than the region gives up its space rather than the
// region: it is cut down to the region instead of overhanging it. That is the
// tiler's rule (internal/layout.spans) applied to a size a person typed.
