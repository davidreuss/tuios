// The rail's files section, drawn beside the other sections rather than instead
// of them. sidebar_files.go says why it is a section and how its listing is
// read; this draws it.
//
// It borrows the rail's grammar wholesale: the same edge rule, the same name
// spine, the same one-cell gutter, the same one-cell glyph column, the same
// right-aligned figures inset one cell from the rail's own edge. A listing that
// looked like a different program bolted to the side of the rail would be one,
// and the point of putting it here rather than in a pane is that it is not.
//
// Every rectangle it publishes is recorded as it draws, exactly as the other
// sections do. Nothing here is recomputed by a handler, and nothing here reads
// the filesystem: the rows come from whatever the last finished read left in
// the model.

// fileTokenCd is the header's one word control. A word rather than a glyph:
// there is no folder-and-arrow symbol that means "take the pane there" and
// survives a terminal with no nerd font, and the rail is wide enough to say it.

// the pane: unpin it and ask for the pane's directory again. A word like its
// neighbour cd, for the same reason.
